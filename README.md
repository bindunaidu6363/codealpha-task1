# CodeAlpha Disease Prediction Model 🏥

 Project Overview

This project is developed as part of the **CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship**.
The main objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a person is likely to have a disease based on medical attributes.

The model analyzes patient health data and classifies the result as **disease present** or **not present**.

---

Objective

* To analyze medical dataset
* To preprocess health data
* To build a classification model
* To predict disease probability accurately

---

 Dataset Used

**Dataset Name:** Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset

### Features in the dataset:

* Pregnancies
* Glucose Level
* Blood Pressure
* Skin Thickness
* Insulin Level
* BMI (Body Mass Index)
* Diabetes Pedigree Function
* Age

### Target Variable:

* **Outcome**

  * 0 → No Disease
  * 1 → Disease Present

---

 Technologies & Libraries Used

### Programming Language

* Python

### Libraries

* Pandas → Data handling and preprocessing
* NumPy → Numerical computations

 Steps Performed in the Project

1. Loaded the dataset
2. Explored and understood the data
3. Handled missing values and cleaned data
4. Split data into training and testing sets
5. Trained Logistic Regression model
6. Predicted disease outcomes
7. Evaluated model performance

 Model Performance

The model was evaluated using:

* Accuracy Score
* Confusion Matrix
* Precision & Recall
* F1-Score

The model achieved reliable accuracy in predicting disease risk.
